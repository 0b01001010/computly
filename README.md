# Development notes

- TODO: Add `target=_blank` and `rel=external` to external links..
  There are two ways to do this: at runtime using `hooks.ts` but this adds a lot of overhead.
  The other way is at build time, and this needs some research.
- TODO: Show language on top of `<pre>` block.
- TODO: Add service worker to support PWA.
- TODO: Add support for infinite scrolling on blog index page using [this package](https://github.com/skayo/svelte-infinite-loading).
- TODO: Fix generate sitemap to include all posts.
